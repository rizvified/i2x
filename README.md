# i2x Challenge

This app uses the awesome https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate for the win!

## Quick start

1. Clone this repo using `git clone https://github.com/rizvified/i2x.git`
1. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
1. Run `npm start` to start the development server
   *At this point you can see the app at `http://localhost:3000`.*

Now you're ready to rumble!
